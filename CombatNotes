TURN BASED COMBAT-

Have so far:
	-stat point system (Armor multiplier (Dmg Reduction), 5+ Base Health, +1 RAM, Precision Chance (Critical Chance/hit), Dodge)
		* Base stats should be:
			-Armor 1.00 (-0.02 to reduce dmg)
			-Health 100
			-3 RAM
			-Crit Chance 10%
			-Dodge 5%
	-level & xp system (seperate xp from enemy encounters and milestones)

	-Player Actions 
		*Melee (Close Combat)
		*Shoot (Ranged Combat)
		*Take Cover
		*CyberHack (Actions explained above)
		*Analyze Enemy

	-Enemy Actions
		*Attack (Melee and Shoot)
		*Take Cover
		*CyberHack
		*
	
	-CyberHack system (if player RAM exceeds enemy RAM then 100% succession / if player RAM is within a 2/3 threshold then 50% of succession / if player RAM does not meet threshold then fail and end turn)
		* If successful, options are:
			- Mind Control (make enemy attack allies for three turns / if enemy has no allies then no effect) 
			- Visual Overload (Blinds an enemy for two turn)
		* If successful and inventory is implemented, options are:
			- Armor Strip (make enemy susceptible to dmg types they would be strong against / set armor multiplier to 1.00)
		(MORE TO BE ADDED MAYBE)
	

POSSIBLE IDEAS:
		
	-Enemy CyberHack system (if action is rolled then 100% succession rate of occuring)
		*EMP Wave (Disables "Shoot" and "CyberHack" / if disabled options chosen then skip turn)
		*Neural Virus (Siphons a random stat from player for three turns)
		(NEEDS MORE)

	-Boss Actions (differ from regular enemies with rising Aggression rates and retaliation moves (GUARANTEED ACTIONS))
		(NEEDS A SPECIAL ACTION)
	
	-Systemic Buffs (I DOUBT THIS WILL HAPPEN BUT I LIKE THE IDEA)
		*Find buffs from either completing battles or completing puzzles that will carry over a certain amount of turns either in or out of battle
		*Example:
			- Find a Precision Glove raising crit chance by 25% for 10 turns
